## Introduction

Welcome to my Student Portfolio Project documentation. This project showcases a basic portfolio a responsive 3-page website. Each page serves a specific purpose, presenting information about me, my hobbies, and providing a means of contact.

## Project Overview

I have successfully completed all aspects of the assignment, incorporating HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website. The project includes the following components:

- Homepage (`index.html`)
- About Me Page (`about.html`)
- Hobby Page (`topic.html`)
- Contact Me Page (`contact.html`)
- Stylesheet for the website (`styles.css`)

## Deployment Link

To view website, simply open the [index.html](https://ysrajsingh.github.io/student-portfolio/) file in a web browser. Navigate through the different pages using the provided hyperlinks.


## File Structure

-   `index.html`: Homepage
-   `about.html`: About Me Page
-   `topic.html`: Hobby Page
-   `contact.html`: Contact Me Page
-   `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the website

## Usage

To view website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Navigate through the different pages using the provided hyperlinks.

## New Features

In addition to meeting the assignment requirements, I incorporated new CSS styles that I discovered independently. These styles are applied globally across all pages, enhancing the overall design. I found these styles through [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
