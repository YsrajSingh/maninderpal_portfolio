# Assignment 1: Website Creation

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of my completed Assignment 1. In this assignment, I created a responsive 3-page website as per the provided instructions.

## Project Overview

I have successfully completed all the components of the assignment, including the creation of three HTML pages, styling with CSS, adding navigation, implementing new CSS styles, and providing image attribution.

## File Structure

-   `index.html`: Homepage
-   `about.html`: About Me Page
-   `topic.html`: Hobby Page
-   `contact.html`: Contact Me Page
-   `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the website

## Instructions

To view my website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can navigate through the different pages using the provided hyperlinks.

## New CSS Styles

I have incorporated new CSS styles that I discovered independently. These styles are applied globally across all pages. I found these styles through https://www.w3schools.com/

## Image Attribution

All images used in this project are https://wallpaperaccess.com/, and they are commented as well.
